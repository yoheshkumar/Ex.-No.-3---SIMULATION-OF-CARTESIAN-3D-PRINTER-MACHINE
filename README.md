SMOOTH ROD :
X and Y linear motion model in 3D design In Cartesian method, there will be two smooth rods on both the corners of the machine in parallel to each other. These smooth rods will be passing through a linear bearing block. This achieves the Y motion.

BEARING :
A Cartesian 3D printer, also known as a Cartesian robot or Cartesian coordinate system printer, is a type of 3D printer that utilizes a Cartesian coordinate system to control its movements. It is named after René Descartes, a mathematician who developed the Cartesian coordinate system.

IDLER :
In a Cartesian 3D printer, an idler is a component that plays a crucial role in the movement and control of the filament during the printing process. The idler is typically part of the extruder assembly and is responsible for guiding and maintaining tension on the filament as it is fed into the printer's hot end or nozzle

EXTRUDER :
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed

MOTOR :
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

Y AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.

Horiz & Vertical Threaded Rod:
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed.

Smooth Rod :
X and Y linear motion model in 3D design In Cartesian method, there will be two smooth rods on both the corners of the machine in parallel to each other. These smooth rods will be passing through a linear bearing block. This achieves the Y motion.

Pulley:
Pulleys are commonly used as part of the motion system to control the movement of the printer's various axes, typically the X-axis and Y-axis. Pulleys are mechanical components that consist of a grooved wheel or drum designed to guide and transmit motion through a belt or a timing belt.

Motor:
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

Y-Axis Frame:
The print bed or build platform is attached to the Y-axis frame and moves along the rails or rods. The movement is facilitated by mechanical mechanisms such as linear bearings or bushings that slide along the rails, ensuring smooth and low-friction motion.

Y-Axis Base:
The Y-axis base is typically made of rigid materials such as metal or sturdy plastic to ensure stability and minimize vibrations during printing. It is designed to withstand the weight of the print bed and any other components attached to it.

Z-Axis Rod:
The Z-axis rod is often a threaded rod with a helical groove along its length. It may have a specific pitch (distance between each rotation of the thread) that determines the amount of vertical movement per revolution. The most common type of Z-axis rod is a lead screw, which has a coarse thread to provide greater mechanical advantage and accuracy.

Z-Axis Top Cover:
In a Cartesian 3D printer, the Z-axis top cover refers to a component or structure that encloses and protects the upper portion of the printer's Z-axis assembly. It is typically positioned above the print bed or build platform and serves multiple purposes.

Motor:
Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

Frame:
The frame of a Cartesian 3D printer is typically constructed using rigid materials such as metal, aluminum extrusions, or sturdy plastic. It is designed to withstand the forces and vibrations generated during the printing process and maintain the desired alignment of the printer's components.

Y-Axis assembly:
In a Cartesian 3D printer, the Y-axis assembly refers to the components and mechanisms responsible for controlling the movement along the Y-axis. The Y-axis is one of the three primary axes in a Cartesian coordinate system, representing the horizontal direction perpendicular to the X-axis.

X-Axis Assembly:
In a Cartesian 3D printer, the X-axis assembly refers to the components and mechanisms responsible for controlling the movement along the X-axis. The X-axis is one of the three primary axes in a Cartesian coordinate system, representing the horizontal direction.

SMPS:
The SMPS in a Cartesian 3D printer typically takes the AC power input from the mains and converts it to DC power with the appropriate voltage and current levels required by the printer's components. The DC power is then distributed to different parts of the printer, including the control board, motors, heating elements, and other electronics.

LCD:
The LCD display is typically integrated into the printer's control board or mounted separately in a convenient location on the printer's frame. It allows users to interact with the printer by providing information, menu navigation, and control options.

Spool Holder:
In a Cartesian 3D printer, a spool holder is a component that is used to hold and feed filament to the extruder during the printing process. The spool holder ensures that the filament spool remains stable and provides a consistent feed of filament to the printer.

Spool :
The spool is designed to keep the filament neatly wound and prevent tangling or knotting. It allows for controlled unwinding of the filament as it is pulled by the extruder during printing.
